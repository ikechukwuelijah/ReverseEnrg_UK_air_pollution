Introduction

This evaluation of air quality was conducted at various locations throughout the United Kingdom. Measurement of air quality, levels of different airborne contaminants such as Nitrogen Monoxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (also known as particle pollution) are all significant contributors to the overall air quality index. Pollution of the air can be harmful and detrimental to the environment, plants, livestock and human health. The information was gathered from 18 monitoring stations in the United Kingdom.
