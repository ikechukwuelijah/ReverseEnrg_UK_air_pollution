# üå´Ô∏è UK Air Pollution Pipeline (Reverse Engineered)

This project reverse-engineers air quality data pipelines for the United Kingdom, ingesting pollution metrics from public APIs and storing them in a PostgreSQL database. The goal is to track key pollutants over time for environmental monitoring, analysis, and forecasting.

## üéØ Core Objectives

- Retrieve real-time and historical air pollution data by location
- Extract and enrich pollutant levels (e.g. NO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5, O‚ÇÉ) by timestamp and area
- Normalize and store records in PostgreSQL for querying and dashboarding
- Offer insights by pollutant type, source, and geographic trend
